        <h3 style="color: blue;">Good Experience</h3>
        <li>I love the environment and the people</li>
        <li>I love the lectures and the way the trainers teach </li>
        <li>The fact that i'm able to learn coding and my career path</li>
        <li>Without forgetting the different kinds of food.</li>

    </ol>
    <ul>
        <h3 style="color: blue;">Bad Experience</h3>
        <li>I won't say coding is easy because its something that im doing for the fist time</li>
        <li>Learning to co-exist in a totally different place </li>
        <li>I barely sleeep enough because i have to make sure that irevise and up to date with what i,m taught. </li>
